Input data:

Training data – file iris_training.txt

Test data – file iris_test.txt

 

Your program will read in the data from those files. You can assume that:

 

The decision attribute is always the last one.

 
All attributes except for the decision are numeric.



Your program must not assume the number of conditional attributes. It must make it out from the input data.

 

You then read in the parameter k from the user.

Perform a k-NN classification of all samples in the test data set. Print out the number of correctly classified samples and the accuracy of the classifier as the percentage of this number to the total number of test samples.

 

You then are required to read in attribute values of new samples from the user and print out their classification result. Repeat until user tells you to stop.

 

As an option, you may include a chart of how the classification accuracy changes with k.

 

You must not use any third party Machine Learning library or tools , all the elements of the algorithm must be implemented from scratch.
